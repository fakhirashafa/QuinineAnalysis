Quinine (Chinchona) contains a white crystalline alkaloid called Quinine. This compound has long been studied as a treatment for malaria. This study aims to evaluate the potential of Quinine as an antimalarial drug through an in silico approach using the reverse docking method. The analysis includes 3D structure validation, molecular docking, drug similarity calculation, and toxicity prediction. In addition to Python, a number of software such as PyRx, PyMol, NCBI, PubChem, PASS online, and UniProt were also used in this study.
